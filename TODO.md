# TODO

Next: Use ytenx data to assign groups hopefully perfectly

Then: Use CJKlib (https://pythonhosted.org/cjklib/cjklib.reading.converter.PinyinWadeGilesConverter-class.html) to convert pinyin to Wade-Giles so words and chars have same pronunciation strings.

* Provide highest frequency word for all characters and their pronunciations
* for unclassified chars:
    - order chars by commonness of that word


* Source new datasets for Chinese!


Prediction experiments:
- components -> Japanese (sanity check with Heisig)
- components -> Mandarin
- Japanese -> Mandarin
- Japanese -> Cantonese
- Cantonese -> Mandarin

* Re-organize and write at least one test


## Tasks

* Convert to frequency list to traditional characters so we have traditional frequency list (roughly)
* generate decision trees with accuracy stats for pronunciations:
    - components -> Japanese (check against Heisig)
    - components -> Mandarin
    - Japanese -> Mandarin
    - Japanese -> Cantonese
    - Cantonese -> Mandarin
* lib for parsing Syllables:
    - Cantonese
    - Vietnamese
* Character lists (grade level, newspaper standard, etc.)
    - generate pronunciation decision trees for subsets

    - HSK (simplified): http://www.chinesetest.cn/userfiles/file/HSK/HSK-2012.xls
    - Seems that frequency lists and class lists are for simplified only. Here's a traditional-simplified converter: https://github.com/berniey/hanziconv/blob/master/hanziconv/charmap.py (Apache 2.0)
    - Ach! Unihan has Hong Kong grade levels included already!
    - Kanken
* Investigate https://github.com/cburgmer/cjklib
    - website is long gone, project no longer maintained abandoned, but it looks pretty comprehensive!
    - Can we revive/modernize it? May be a better data source!
* Investigate http://ocbaxtersagart.lsait.lsa.umich.edu/ (historical reconstructions)
    - try to predict Mandarin/Cantonese from Middle Chinese or reconstructions?
    - an old version has been uploaded to wiktionary and needs to be updated
    - sent an email asking for the license
* Investigate http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2012/pdf/306_Paper.pdf
    - lists some good resources
    - they don't share their results :(
* Investigate https://humanum.arts.cuhk.edu.hk/Lexis/lexi-mf/
    - seems they have a very permissive license (used in Wiktionary), but the content is not downloadable as a single file. This resource is truly amazing; if only it were more easily accessible!
* build_db should download radicals data
* generate decision tree for pronunciations:
    - radicals -> joyo Japanese
    - radicals -> hsk Mandarin
    - radicals -> hsk Cantonese
* Investigate Wiktionary
    - has become much more extensive in recent years!
    - sino-xenic compound cognates are already there (see https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%94%E7%A9%80)
    - lua error on some pages?
        - example: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E4%BA%BA
        - tracker: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T165935
    - can/should I contribute directly to wiktionary?
        - seems like data is very hit and miss; ‰∫∫ article for Korean contains many compounds. Check page for ‰∫∫ÂäõËªä and it doesn't have a sino-xenic descendants section ü§î
    - would it still be valuable to create my own database?
        - probably, if nothing else we can find what wiktionary is missing
* Investigate OpenCC

## Questions/Needs

* Try this phono-semantic character data instead of IDS: https://github.com/cjkvi/cjkvi-ids/issues/84
* Legal character classifications (grade levels, Jouyou, etc.)
* DB for on readings by period (go-on, kan-on, tou-on, etc.)
* DB for historical kun'yomi
    - (very) partial dataset: https://www.bunka.go.jp/kokugo_nihongo/sisaku/joho/joho/kijun/naikaku/gendaikana/huhyo_i.html
* unihan kun'yomi don't indicate okurigana!
* historical spellings, with wi, we, ye, etc. for Japanese

## Ideas

* Generate shiritori sequence for all characters in a group

## Issues to Open

* Make the on'yomi parser slightly less accommodating and then report misspellings to Unihan
* poetry: script aliases like for npm; test-all = `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`, etc.
* Unihan does not link È∫∫ and È∫µ as variants (Wikipedia correctly shows trad/simp/sinjitai)
* Unihan does not indicate where okurigana in a kun'yomi begin
* Would be great if unihan-etl (or better yet, Unihan itself!) structurized the (traditional variant of X), (non-classical variant of X), (same as X), etc. in the `kDefinition` field.
    - „ë∂ is listed as the traditional variant of „êπ, but the Mandarin pronunciations are different! The kDefinition field notes that it's treated as a variant of ‰ª°, which does have the same pronunciation.
* unihan_etl uses arrays for several fields that should not be arrays, such as `kJoyoKanji`, `kKarlgren`, etc. Maybe that's an attempt to future-proof?

## Dev Tools
* integrate darglint and/or pydocstyle to help keep documentation together
* mypy doesn't check that types are used in signatures, nor that methods are used correctly üò° Maybe try pyre, pyright, or pytype
* verify vscode integration
* Standalone build script
* Dockerfile

## Technical Questions
* Should we use importlib or something intead of Path(__file__).parents[1]?
